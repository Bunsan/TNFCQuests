You will then need to cover the entire log pile with a non-flammable block, except for one open block. Ensure that there are no air spaces. To light the pit, drop a torch on the top of the log pile you left exposed. There will be a sparking animation and eventually the log pile will catch fire. Quickly cover the burning log pile with a non-flammable block. You will should see smoke particles coming from the active charcoal pit, but sometimes the smoke particles bug out. The pit will turn into charcoal over the next 18 in-game hours. Once there are no more smoke particles you can uncover the pit and dig our your charcoal with a shovel. Again the smoke particles can bug out. This is why we suggest covering your first charcoal pit with dirt as some of the dirt will collapse when the pit finishes.",

There are 4 chisel modes in TFC, you may have to rebind the mode button to switch between them. You can tell which mode you are in by the icon to the right of your hotbar. Smooth mode smooths raw stone. Stair mode will remove 1/8 of a block at a time. Slab mode will shave a 1/8 slice off the block. Detailed mode allows you to chip away tiny bits. The chisel isn\u0027t just for stone; you can chisel many other blocks as well. Be aware you can\u0027t chisel any raw stone that has 2 or more pieces of raw stone above it. TNFC has the TerrafirmaStuff addon, which adds additional chisel modes, whose icons are slightly blue. It adds a Smooth mode that only works on hardened clay blocks. Chiseled mode that works on hardened clay and Mineral Blocks (Jet, Serpentine and Quartz). Circle mode that works on stone and hardened clay blocks. And Pillar mode that works on stone, hardened clay and mineral blocks. This task accepts any chisel.",
